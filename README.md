# Routine-Tracker-in-Python
This is a routine tracker app built in Python using MySQL for data storage.

The app is pretty simple to use, it just requires python and MySQL to be installed on your computer.

For setup just open the code once and change the "Password" in line 16 to the password of MySQL for root user, you can change the user aswell if you wish but ensure to use the corresponding password.
Voila! the app is ready, to use it just double click on the "Routine.py" file or open the file in your code editor and hit run.
